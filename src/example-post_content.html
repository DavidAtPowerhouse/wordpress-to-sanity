Mike Cannon-Brookes has hailed decarbonisation as the largest economic opportunity for Australia during his <em>100 Climate Conversations</em> talk at Powerhouse.

Atlassian CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes spoke to journalist Rae Johnston about the economic potential of exporting Australia’s sunshine, ethical investments and how Atlassian is harnessing renewables and science-based targets to reach carbon neutral by 2040.

‘Decarbonisation is the largest economic opportunity facing Australia,’ said Cannon-Brookes when asked why he is encouraging AGL towards renewables after securing a significant 11.28 per cent stake in the company.

‘We should have the cheapest power in the world. If we don't get there before everybody else, those industries, those jobs, those economic opportunities will go to the places that have that cheap power and it will be really hard for us to get it back.

‘So, this is where we have this opportunity in Australia if we lean into it in the next decade to not only decarbonise and do good things from a planetary emissions and climate sense, but also from an economic sense. That is the opportunity that we're seizing ahead of other nations that will then keep us ahead for hopefully decades afterwards,’ Cannon-Brookes said.

The outspoken advocate for renewable energy has been instrumental in advocating for large-scale energy works in Australia, including engaging Elon Musk to address South Australia’s 2016 blackouts with the nation’s first large-scale battery.

Cannon-Brookes is also a key investor in Sun Cable, the world's largest solar energy infrastructure project with a $20 billion plan to deliver Australian solar power to Singapore.

‘We have a lot of land, we have a lot of sun, a lot of wind, and we have 3 billion consumers to the north that don't have that luxury of space and everything else that we have,’ Cannon-Brookes said.

‘We just want to export that sunshine to other people’.

Cannon-Brookes urged investors to follow his model of investing in climate-conscious businesses and philanthropic causes, noting ‘the next eight years is the really critical period’.

‘The momentum of it is going to run away from us if we don’t do significant things in the next eight years,’ he said.
